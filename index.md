# Press release

>NEW YORK, March 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ConsenSys, the 700-person Ethereum technology company, today announced commercial availability of technical support and professional services for Quorum. Quorum is an open-source enterprise blockchain platform built on Ethereum to ensure high throughput processing of private transactions within a permissioned group of participants. 
>
>Ethereum's use of smart contracts is an obvious choice for reducing the friction of verification and communication among payment participants around the world. For financial institutions requiring high-throughputs and transaction privacy, Quorum was built as a private blockchain protocol based on the Go implementation of the Ethereum protocol.

>Joe Lubin, Founder of ConsenSys and Co-Founder of Ethereum said, "The trustworthy transactions and agreements platform, enabled by the Quorum version of Ethereum for permissioned implementations, enables organizations to fluidly collaborate with one another on shared infrastructure. ConsenSys has established an enterprise-grade Customer Success organization which will provide management, technical support, and a Network Operation Center to ensure high availability, performance, and world class support for our Quorum enterprise customers. We continue to work closely with the EEA to encourage collaboration between enterprise and public Ethereum communities."
>
>Ron Resnick, Executive Director of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, said, "In the EEA, we have significant participation from many member companies building production-scale applications based on Quorum. Plus, the resources that ConsenSys has provided to support work activity in the EEA has been invaluable. The EEA's Quorum Working Group is dedicated to writing contributions to support EEA work in delivering a standard specification serving the entire EEA community and is doing a great job supporting this effort."
>
>The EEA is a non-profit industry consortium that defines standards so applications built on an Ethereum-derived platform will be compatible with other Ethereum implementations, in addition to providing of enterprise tools and support. With the assistance of ConsenSys, Quorum has already successfully been implemented for financial institutions like Santander and the Monetary Authority of Singapore's Project Ubin.
>
>"ConsenSys is supporting the development of Quorum to address the concerns of organizations looking for private chain governance; this work is also enabling significant contributions to the upcoming Enterprise Ethereum specification," said Jeremy Millar, board member of the EEA and Chief of Staff at ConsenSys.
>
>Whilst Quorum has been designed with financial services use cases in mind, its implementation is appropriate for other organizations interested in using Ethereum but requiring privacy and high-throughput functionality.
>
>Dror Avieli joined ConsenSys this year after building HPE Software's own SAAS group from the ground up. As VP of Customer Success at ConsenSys, he is dedicated to building up the three pillars of support for Quorum. Dror commented, "The first, a best-in-class Customer Success Management team, will own the enterprise customer relationship from on-boarding to renewal, ensuring quick ROI and increasing adoption of Quorum. The second group will use cutting edge solutions to provide enterprise and SMB support. And third, a Network Operation Center will focus on providing clear processes and transparency to our decentralized Ethereum applications guaranteeing high availability and performance that our customers can count on."
